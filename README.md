# Waste-Detection

A crucial phase in the recycling process is waste sorting. It is a labor- and time intensive procedure, and accurate garbage sorting can be challenging, especially when the material is polluted or mixed. This is suggested to use a fresh strategy plan for waste management that is both active and effective in trash cans. Through the use of predefined neural network CNN this proposed framework will assist in maximizing the efficacy of waste management. Sorting garbage is a critical step in the recycling process. Accurate rubbish sorting can be difficult and time-consuming, especially when the material is contaminated or mixed.Waste sorting is an essential component of the recycling process, ensuring that materials are properly separated and processed for optimal resource recovery. However, this task can be challenging due to the heterogeneity of waste 
streams, the presence of contaminants, and the potential for human error. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework for waste sorting using a convolutional neural network (CNN).The proposed framework utilizes a pre-trained CNN architecture to classify waste items into predefined categories. The CNN is trained on a large dataset of labeled waste images, enabling it to identify and differentiate between various types of materials, even in the presence of contamination. This capability 
enhances the accuracy and efficiency of waste sorting, reducing the need for manual intervention and improving the overall quality of recycled materials.
